            "Rene Wise delivers powerful, percussive techno to stir up movement. His signature sound is grounded and driving â€” raw but modern rhythm set in motion to create atmospheric soundscapes, where body and sound converge. Never overbearing, always precise and in control. He curates the imprint Moving Pressure, a label that reflects his sound aesthetic: stripped-down, groove-heavy techno, coming from a background of percussion. Obscur's recent release on the label connects our scene with Rene's through a shared sonic ethos â€” tight, raw, and deeply felt.",
