Ed is a British producer and DJ with residency in Berlin, where he regularly releases explorative techno and ambient productions on his home label Counterchange and mixes heavier stuff in Berghain or stirs up Monday mornings in Panorama. In Kader, he will start his techno set as Inland, while we can expect more playfulness at dawn.",
